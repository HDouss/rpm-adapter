## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

To avoid build errors use Maven 3.2+.

Pay attention that our `pom.xml` inherits a lot of configuration
from [jcabi-parent](http://parent.jcabi.com).
[This article](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/05/jcabi-parent-maven-pom.html)
explains why it's done this way.
